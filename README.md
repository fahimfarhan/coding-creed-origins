## Hello there! 
Thank you for visiting! Feel free to see the codes. But it would be nice if you try the problems yourself first :) 
And I would really like to know who you are. Perhaps you could `Star` the repo :)
Thank you for reading.

## Cool Stuffs
```
    int a[100] = {0}; // shorter way to initialize in cpp. yeah, I didn't know that
```
```
next_permutation(v.begin(), v.end());
```

```
regex_match(s,regex("(1|14|144)*"));
```

```
std::string data = "Abc";
std::transform(data.begin(), data.end(), data.begin(), ::tolower);
```
```
for (std::string::size_type i = 0; i < str.length(); ++i)
    std::cout << std::tolower(str[i], loc);
```

### UVA style input... 
```
while(getline(cin, s[line])){
            if(s[line].length()>longest){
                longest = s[line].length();
            }
